# 🟢 BEGINNER LEVEL

## 1. **What is Minitab?**
**Answer:**  
Minitab is a statistical analysis software used in Quality Management, Six Sigma, Lean, and business analytics. It simplifies complex data tasks such as hypothesis testing, regression, control charts, and capability studies.

---

## 2. **What are the main sections of the Minitab interface?**
**Answer:**  
- **Session Window** – Displays statistical results  
- **Worksheet** – Excel-like data entry grid  
- **Project Manager** – Organizes all outputs, graphs, and worksheets  

---

## 3. **What type of data can you enter in Minitab?**
**Answer:**  
Numeric, text (categorical), date/time, binary, continuous, and discrete datasets.

---

## 4. **What is a histogram used for?**
**Answer:**  
A histogram helps visualize data distribution and understand patterns such as symmetry, skewness, or outliers.

---

## 5. **What is a boxplot?**
**Answer:**  
A boxplot shows data spread using quartiles, median, and potential outliers. It is useful for comparing multiple groups visually.

---

## 6. **Where do you find descriptive statistics in Minitab?**
**Answer:**  
`Stat → Basic Statistics → Display Descriptive Statistics`

---

## 7. **What is the purpose of a control chart?**
**Answer:**  
A control chart tracks process stability over time and identifies variations that may require corrective action.

---

## 8. **What is a p-value?**
**Answer:**  
A p-value indicates the probability of observing results by chance.  
- **p < 0.05:** Statistically significant  
- **p ≥ 0.05:** Not significant  

---

## 9. **What is a Pareto chart?**
**Answer:**  
A Pareto chart ranks causes of problems using the 80/20 rule, helping identify the most impactful issues.

---

## 10. **What is correlation?**
**Answer:**  
Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

---

---

# 🟡 INTERMEDIATE LEVEL

## 11. **What is Regression in Minitab?**
**Answer:**  
Regression identifies relationships between independent variables and a response variable. Minitab provides linear, multiple, and polynomial regression models.

---

## 12. **What is multicollinearity and how do you detect it?**
**Answer:**  
Multicollinearity occurs when predictors are strongly correlated. Minitab identifies it using **VIF (Variance Inflation Factor)** values.

---

## 13. **Explain Capability Analysis.**
**Answer:**  
Capability analysis determines how well a process meets customer specification limits using metrics like:
- **Cp, Cpk** (Short-term performance)  
- **Pp, Ppk** (Long-term performance)  

---

## 14. **Difference between Cp and Cpk?**
**Answer:**  
- **Cp:** Checks potential capability assuming centered process  
- **Cpk:** Checks actual capability considering process shift  

---

## 15. **What is an I-MR chart used for?**
**Answer:**  
The I-MR chart is used when:
- Sample size = **1**  
- Tracking individual observations  
- Monitoring variations over time  

---

## 16. **How do you check normality in Minitab?**
**Answer:**  
Use:  
`Graph → Probability Plot`  
or  
`Stat → Basic Statistics → Normality Test`  
The Anderson-Darling test provides a p-value for normality.

---

## 17. **What is Chi-Square Test in Minitab?**
**Answer:**  
Chi-square tests are used to analyze categorical data and determine if distributions differ from expected patterns.

---

## 18. **What is ANOVA used for?**
**Answer:**  
ANOVA compares means of multiple groups and checks whether differences are statistically significant.

---

## 19. **Explain Residual Plots.**
**Answer:**  
Residual plots evaluate regression model accuracy. Ideally, residuals should be random with no visible patterns.

---

## 20. **What is a Control Limit vs Specification Limit?**
**Answer:**  
- **Control limits:** Based on process data (UCL, LCL)  
- **Specification limits:** Based on customer requirements (USL, LSL)  

---

---

# 🔴 ADVANCED LEVEL

## 21. **What is DOE (Design of Experiments) in Minitab?**
**Answer:**  
DOE helps study multiple factors simultaneously to understand their effect on a response. Minitab supports:
- Full factorial designs  
- Fractional factorial designs  
- Response Surface Methodology (RSM)  

---

## 22. **Explain Gage R&R Study.**
**Answer:**  
Gage R&R assesses measurement system variation by analyzing:
- Repeatability (equipment variation)  
- Reproducibility (operator variation)  
It ensures the measurement system is reliable.

---

## 23. **How do you interpret R² and Adjusted R² in regression?**
**Answer:**  
- **R²:** Explains variation explained by the model  
- **Adjusted R²:** Adjusted for the number of predictors; more accurate for multiple regression  

---

## 24. **What is Time Series Forecasting in Minitab?**
**Answer:**  
Minitab supports forecasting using:
- Exponential smoothing  
- ARIMA models  
Used for predicting future trends using historical data.

---

## 25. **What is a General Linear Model (GLM)?**
**Answer:**  
GLM handles multiple predictors (continuous + categorical) and interactions. It is used for complex ANOVA and regression.

---

## 26. **Explain Interaction Plots.**
**Answer:**  
Interaction plots show how two factors together influence the response. Non-parallel lines indicate interaction.

---

## 27. **What is Box-Cox Transformation?**
**Answer:**  
It converts non-normal data into a normal distribution using a transformation power (λ). Minitab automatically suggests optimal λ.

---

## 28. **What is a CUSUM chart used for?**
**Answer:**  
CUSUM detects small shifts in process mean more sensitively than traditional control charts.

---

## 29. **What is a Root Cause Validation using statistical tools?**
**Answer:**  
Experts use hypothesis testing, capability analysis, and regression to validate whether identified root causes truly impact the problem.

---

## 30. **How do you automate repetitive tasks in Minitab?**
**Answer:**  
Using:
- **Macros (.MTB scripts)**  
- **User-defined commands**  
This saves time in large-scale or repeated analyses.
